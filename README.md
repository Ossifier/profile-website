# profile-website
Personal profile website designed in HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

This is an under construction personal profile website designed to function as a learning project to develop my web design and programming capabilities.
Upon completion, this website will also function as a hub for sharing various other projects that I work on and complete as I continue developing them, as well as any relevant news.

To examine the page and its components, download all files as a zip, extract, and open the filed entitled "index.html" in your web browser.

At this time, two separate folders are present in this repo, one representing the web page itself, and the other an animated loading page that will be integrated into the page at a later date.

Do note that this is currently an incomplete project, and represents a work in progress. As such, cross-browser consistency remains untested, and responsive design elements are currently unimplemented as of yet. The loading page should work fine on any media, but the profile page itself is best viewed in a desktop environment.

## TO DO:
1. Format and complete the "Services" and "Projects" subpages.
2. Create a functional photo gallery for the "Photography" subpage.
3. Add functionality to the forms in the "Contacts" subpage.
4. Integrate the loading page into the main profile page.
5. Implement responsive media queries so that the page is better viewed on tablets and phones.

## TO CONSIDER:
1. Consider using a classes such as ".hidden" and ".visible" in CSS for Heading and Content animations to be added/removed with JavaScript, rather than directly manipulating the DOM elements using JavaScript (such as ".opacity = 0" or ".zIndex = -1")
2. As above, consider implementing visibility properties into the CSS for the above ".hidden" classes.
3. Consider removing the "Services" subsection for the time being, and replacing it with "Skills" instead.
